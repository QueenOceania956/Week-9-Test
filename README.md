# Week-9-Test

**Name at least two things to check for debugging for when your code isn’t working (bonus points for more then two).**

Look for missing parentheses, ending tags, and other things. Make sure you don't have IDs where Variables should be and vice versa.


**Why won’t this work? In your HTML: `<input class=”.some-element” type=“text” />` In your Javascript: `$(“.another-element”).val();`**

Because one is not a variable, as the $ changes it to something else. I can't remember what though.


**What’s the relationship between JavaScript and jQuery?**

jQuery is a website that is filled with help on Javascript,


**What does `var name = $(‘.name-field’).val();` do?**

It  gives the variable an ID? Or hides it????



**How do we make sure an element is hidden when the page is first loaded? Hint: you don’t need any javascript! How do we then unhide that element using javascript?**

UHhhhhhh...hey look, it's the ice cream man! *points and runs off* Anyway, I forgot the answer. I think it had something to do with the dollar signs???


**What’s the difference between `$(‘#myElement’)` and `$(‘.myElement’)`?**

One is an ID and one is a variable.
